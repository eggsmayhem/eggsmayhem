### Hello there  :dancer:

Hello stranger. I'm a fullstack engineer specializing in web development, generally working with NodeJs and React during the daytime. I also use Python for Machine Learning (focusing on NLP) and web scraping/automation. I am particularly interested in building international teams and using machine learning to help people build mirrors to reflect their creativity and learn about themselves. I am currently working on giving ML bots voices, ears, noses, and personalities, and using vector embeddings to build creative semantic apps using archetypes.
